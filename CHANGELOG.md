# Changelog

## Phase 1 – Shell App Scaffold
- Added PySide6 app entrypoint with drag-and-drop MAR picker, progress bar, and summary chips.
- Implemented background worker stub that simulates auditing and writes placeholder TXT output.
- Added dev tooling (`scripts/dev`, `.vscode/launch.json`, and PySide6 requirement) to streamline local runs.
